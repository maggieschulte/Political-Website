<h3>Rise of a First Lady<h3>

	</head>
	
<body>

<p>Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for the 2016 election. She was once known as 
the First Lady, when her husband, Bill Clinton, was president from 1993 to 2001. Hillary was 
raised in the small town of Park Ridge, Illinois. Clinton was elected in 2000 as the first 
female senator from New York and hopefully one day will as well be the first woman in the 
Oval Office. Also in July of 2016, Hillary formally accepted her party's nomination.</p>

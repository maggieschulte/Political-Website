<h2>Importance of a New Generation<h2>

<h3>This election will mark one of the first, where the Baby Boomers will 
not dominate the voting polls. Gen X and the Millennials ranks are growing as young adults
are now eligible to vote. To stay in contact with those voters of a new generation, Trump 
and Clinton frequently use Twitter as an outlet to express their political views. 
You can view Trump's Twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">here</a>
and Clinton's Twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton">here</a>.<h3>
